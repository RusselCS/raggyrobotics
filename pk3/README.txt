ROBOENZA FRENZY
Mod by Russel
for MM8BDM v6b

Take to the streets during the Roboenza Pandemic!
The virus overwrites your programming, making you want to tear everyone apart and spread the virus further.
Stifle your local outbreaks by destroying infected robots.

ROBOENZA FRENZY is a revival of the classic Rage Roboenza mode by Messatsu. If you've played other shooters.
Inspired by your typical "zombie infection" mode, your goal as a survivor is to snuff out the zombie outbreak.
If you become infected, your goal changes: infect as many players as you can before dying out.

High-performing players are additionally rewarded: they become empowered with a "Frenzy Bonus" that enhances
their attack power.

Finally, defeated infected players have a chance of dropping a cure. Sometimes, miracles do happen.

Changes from Rage Roboenza:
- This is a full rebuild of the roboenza mode, taking heavy inspiration from Rage Roboenza.
- Infections no longer use the Morph system. Instead, they are given a weapon they cannot deselect.
- Player can select a skin they are swapped to when infected.
- Newly redone graphical assets.
- New sound effects.
- Music choices now reflect the MM8BDM campaign.
- Mode runs in TLMS instead of LMS, which makes it much easier to track players and allows for easier win/loss checking.
